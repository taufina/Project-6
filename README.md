# Project 6
 Portfolio of projects

I added a transform property on .portfolio-index .cell:hover, and scaled it up to 1.2 so that when the user hovers over the image on portfolio, it will enlargen. 

I also made the corners of my buttons rounder.  The buttons will also become larger when the user hovers over it.

The background color is changed.  

I changed the color of the title of my portfolio and added a text shadow.
